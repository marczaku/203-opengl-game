# 203 3D OpenGL Game

Hi, my name is Marc and I am an enthusiastic Software Developer and Lecturer.\
A lot of ‚è±Ô∏è time and many years of iteration went into the preparation of this class material.\

In this course, you'll get to make your own 3D Game using Open GL and C++.\
You can pick yourself a game that you'd like to create.

## GroupSize
1-4 Team Members

## Considerations

### Physics
Avoid complex 3D Physics.

Doable:
- 2D Physics (with 3D Rendering)
- 3D Box or Sphere Collision checks (Trigger)
- Gravity

Avoid:
- 3D Physics Simulation (e.g. kicking a Ball, driving a Car)
- Raycasting

### Level/Environment
You won't have a Level Editor, so keep it simple.

### Graphics
You might only be able to work with simple shapes like Cubes and Planes.\
But there's also an (advanced) option for importing 3D Models!

## Game Suggestion
- 2.5D Snake Game
- 2.5D Pong
- 2.5D Space Invaders

## Grading Criteria

### Passing (G)
- Released a Windows Build on itch.io
- It has a visual state
- The state changes based on input
- There is a win condition and state or progression
- Documentation:
  - Video
  - 2 Screenshots
  - Description

### Excellent (VG)
- Delivered a fully playable Game
- Used and documented at least 2 Design Patterns
- (Mostly) Followed Clean Code Guidelines
